                  2023-07-13 - v.4.0.0-4.1.3 - When configuring an S3 Collector, JavaScript expressions break the "Auto-populate from" option for the Path field [CRIBL-18844]
               </h3>
               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>:  When automatically populating an S3 Collector from an S3 Destination, the collector Path field won’t resolve JavaScript expressions, even if the expression was valid on the Destination that the field was populated from. The S3 Collector path is treated like a literal string and the software fails to warn you that the path is invalid.

                  <strong>Workaround</strong>: None.

                  2023-07-07 - v.4.1.3 - When configuring an HTTP Source, enabling Source PQ changes the inputId in events [CRIBL-18668]
               </h3>
               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>:  When Source-side Persistent Queueing is enabled on an HTTP Source, the trailing colon is dropped from __inputId. This will break Routes and filters that are based on the Input ID if it is copied from the configuration page. Live captures will also stop working until you modify them.

               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: In the File Monitor Source and the Explore > Files tab UI, the Manual mode does not honor the Max depth setting.

               <p>

               </h3>
               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: The Office 365 Activity Source misses events due to the current collection system. For services such as Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams, Microsoft indicates that audit record availability is typically 60 to 90 minutes after an event occurs. Our current collector methodology does not account for this availability window. Instead, the Source completes runs as scheduled and collects only events it finds during the configured time range, which can lead to missed events.

               </h3>
               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: In 4.1.1, to improve product security, we changed how we manage our RPC traffic from Leaders and Workers. This change can have a negative impact in larger environments with many Worker Processes. Following a 4.1.1 or 4.1.2 upgrade, the Leader can become non-responsive to UI requests due to a steady 100% CPU utilization. When this happens, you cannot manage or monitor CriblStream environments.

               </h3>
               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: A Source with Persistent Queueing enabled can mistakenly re-engage queueing while still draining its queue - leading to blocked throughput and backpressure. This occurs after a Destination goes offline and back online, once or more, leaving the Source in an undetermined queue state.

               <p>
                  <strong>Workaround</strong>: Wait 60 seconds for another queue drain event, to see if PQ behavior goes back to normal. If the problem persists, restart CriblStream.

               </h3>
               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: Some QuickConnect connections send data to an unintended Destination. We've observed this in single-instance deployments that include the Cribl-supplied <code>cribl_metrics_rollup</code> Pipeline, or include other Pipelines/Packs with stateful Functions like RollupMetrics or Aggregations. Datawill either flow through Routes instead of your specified QuickConnect Destination, or will continue flowing to the original QuickConnect Destination after you drag the connection to a different Destination.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>Workaround</strong>: Use the <strong>DataRoutes</strong> interface to manage the Pipeline and stateful Functions indicated above. Ifyour QuickConnect data doesn't oblige a changed QuickConnect Destination, restart LogStream. This will stop data flow to the unintended Destination, and redirect it to the intended Destination.

               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: Collectors can retrieve data from undesired time ranges, instead of from the range specified. If paths are organized by date/time, this can also cause Collectors to retrieve data from the wrong paths. The root cause is that in the Collector's Run and Schedule configuration modals, time ranges are set based on the browser's time zone, whereas LogStream's backend assumes UTC.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>Workaround</strong>: Offset the <strong>Earliest</strong> and <strong>Latest</strong> date/time values based on your browser's offset from UTC.

                  <strong>Problem</strong>: In <a url="data-preview" href="https://docs.cribl.io/stream/data-preview" target="_blank">Preview or Capture</a>, incoming events like <code>_raw</code> will be displayed in the right pane with an <code>α</code> symbol that indicates string data.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>Cause</strong>: Due to the nature of JSON serialization, the incoming event's <code>Date</code> field is misleadingly subsumed under the event's <code>α</code> string symbol. It's actually a structured type, not a string...yet.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>Workaround</strong>: If you see unexpected <code>null</code> results, stringify the datetime field as you extract it, e.g.: <code>new Date().toISOString()</code>. Feeding the resulting field to Time methods should return datetime strings as expected.

                  <strong>Problem</strong>: After upgrading to v.2.4.3, the UI fails to recognize valid TLS <code>.key</code> files, displaying spurious error messages of the form:
                  "File does not exist: <code>$CRIBL_HOME/local/cribl/auth/certs/&lt;keyname&gt;key</code>."

                  <strong>Workaround</strong>: Ideally, specify an absolute path to each key file, rather than relying on environment variables. If you're locked out of the UI, you'll need to manually edit the referenced paths within these configuration files in LogStream subdirectories: <code>local/cribl/cribl.yml</code> (General &gt; APIServer TLS settings) and/or <code>local/_system/instance.yml</code> (Distributed &gt; TLS settings). Contact Cribl Support if you need assistance. Amore drastic workaround is to disable TLS for the affected connections.

               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: On the <strong>Routes</strong> page, selecting <strong>CaptureNew</strong> in the right pane does not copy custom <strong>Filter</strong> expressions to the resulting <strong>Capture Sample Data</strong> modal. Thatmodal's <strong>FilterExpression</strong> field always defaults to <code>true</code>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>Workarounds</strong>: 1. Bypass the <strong>CaptureNew</strong> button. Instead, from the Route's own •••(Options) menu, select <strong>Capture</strong>. This initiates a capture with the <strong>FilterExpression</strong> correctly populated. 2.Copy/paste the expression into the <strong>Capture Sample Data</strong> modal's <strong>FilterExpression</strong> field. Or,if the expression is displayed in that field's history drop-down, retrieve it.

               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: LogStream reports an expired Free license, and blocks inputs, even though Free licenses in v.2.3.0 do not expire. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>Workaround</strong>: This is caused by time-limited Free license key originally entered in a LogStream version prior to 2.3.0. Go to <strong>Settings&gt; Licensing</strong>, click to select and expand your expired Free license, and click <strong>Deletelicense</strong>. LogStream will recognize the new, permanent Free license, and will restore throughput.

               <p>
                  <strong>Problem</strong>: Where event fields have null values, LogStream (by default) displays them as struck-out in the right Preview pane. The preview is misleading, because the events are still sent to the output.

               <p>
